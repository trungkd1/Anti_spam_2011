Hi,
just a suggestion for your android "anti sms spam": it would be useful to have a counter of blacklisted SMS.
Thank you for your job!

Hello

Your prog is quite good!!!
In next version would you add prefix and susfix to private numbers?
Is good option to hide any numbers starts with number for ex. 101xxxxxxx  in my country sms send from net start with this prefix.

Very thenx and good job


Thanks a lot for your quick response.
I have not activated block unknown numbers. But yes, I am using text filters. 
Most of the bulk spam sms that we get these days do not show the sender's number. 
They only show some text. But I  also need to get important sms related to my work 
which are also  sent as bulk sms showing only text as sender's number . 
What do I do so that sms from these  numbers are not blocked?

I have a small suggestion for the whitelist feature. Is it possible to
add a button just like with the blacklist, so that enabling it will
automatically whitelist all the contacts? Currently you have to add them
one by one and it is very tiresome.

Best.
